## Description
A regular expression, is a sequence of characters that defines a specific search pattern. When included in code or search algorithms, regular expressions may be used to find specific patterns of characters within a string, or rather, to find and replace a character or sequence of characters within a string. They are also frequently used to validate input.
In this gist you'll find an explanation to a specific regex. In addition, I have provided the definitions and some examples of different regex components that you may refer back to as needed. Some are not utilized in the specific regex I will be referring to, but serve to help you gain a better understanding of Javascript regular expressions, aka regex.
