## Regex Components

### Anchors

Anchors assert that the engine's current position in the string matches a specific location. They don't match a character persay, but rather match a position before or after certain characters. It is also very efficient. If you tell the engine that you would like to find a complex pattern in a specific location, it does not spend time looking elsewhere, it will simply look in that location. 

- Examples of anchor characters
    - ^ matches the beginning of the text 
    - $ matches the end of the text
